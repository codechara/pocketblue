### Install Fedora Atomic on mipad5

- **your current os and all your files will be deleted**
- you should have `bash`, `adb` and `fastboot` installed on your computer
- download one of the latest release archives [from here](https://github.com/pocketblue/pocketblue/actions/workflows/images-mipad5.yml); you have to be logged into your github account
- unarchive it
- boot into fastboot and connect the device to your computer via usb
- make sure bootloader is unlocked
- run `bash flash_mipad5.sh`
- reboot and enjoy fedora

### Usage

- default username: `user`
- default password: `123456`
- to upgrade the system use `bootc upgrade` or `rpm-ostree upgrade`
- after that you should run `sudo ostree admin finalize-staged` to apply the ugrade
- this is required because the shutdown process is currently broken and may cause the system to freeze or crash
